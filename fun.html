        <h3><b> Cooking </b></h3>
        <p> 
            During my free time, I enjoy cooking multi-cultural cuisines. I watch cooking videos from BuzzFeed's Tasty app and
            YouTube, and prepare meals that are cost-friendly. My favorite and most recent dessert I prepared was a Chocholate Bowl.
            I used a pudding holder to place a melted dark chocholate and froze it for 3 hours. I then carefully extracted the molded
            chocholate and poured melted white chocholate on the bottom. This created a unique design which I solidified by freezing it 
            for an additional hour. Finally, I filled the bowl with chocholate pudding, chocholate chips and strawberries! It was absolutely
            delicious!!! Below are some of the dishes I've created in the past.

            I am also a fan of Chelsea Football Club, which I've supported since second grade. One of my best memories was in 2012 when Chelsea
            won the coveted Champions league trophy against Bayern Munich. It was an emotional night watching our team go to extra time after
            Didier Drogba scored the equalizer in the last minutes. The game was decided by a penalty, which Bastian Schweinsteiger missed and 
            gave us our first Champions League trophy! Currently, our team is led by former player Frank Lampard and boasts a youthful, talented 
            squad. Recent signings include Christian Pulisic (U.S. international attacker), Timo Werner (Striker), Hakim Ziyech (Right Midfielder),
            and Kai Havertz (Central Midfielder). Below is the current top-10 English Premier League table standings.
