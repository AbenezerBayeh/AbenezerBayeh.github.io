            <p> <br/> <br/> <br/> <br/>BraillEazy is a business venture I co-founded on November 2020. It is focused on building technologies
                that help the Blind easily learn and use Braille. Even though Braille is important for the financial 
                and social wellbeing of the blind, Braille literacy is currently at an alarmingly low 10% rate. We saw 
                that the primary reason was the convenience offered by audio technologies like screen readers, and the 
                lack of evolution of Braille. Hence, we designed a smartphone case that allows the blind to read Braille 
                right from the comfort of their palm. This is accomplished by simulating Braille movement through actuated pins
                loacted on the side of the case and using apps for teaching. 
            <br/><br/>
                We have been involved in multiple entrepreneurial programs and 
                competitions including gALPHA and the Fowler Global Social Innovation Challenge, which have helped us 
                through mentorship and seed funding. BraillEazy is currently completing its incorporation process and 
                aims to apply for research grants that can help us produce prototypes. We have established a partnership 
                with the MN chapter of the National Federation of the Blind, which will help us creating a focus group to 
                test our completed prototypes before we enter production.

                <br/> <br/> During my year-long work stint at the <a href="https://www.stthomas.edu/law/" target="_blank">University of St. Thomas School of Law</a>, I was tasked to create an Amazon 
                Alexa skill that helped law students find available rooms in the Law library. The project required learning
                about Alexa skills and gaining access of the UST library database. Over the course of the 2018 J-term semester,
                I completed this project using <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/alexa/alexa-skills-kit" target="_blank">Alexa Skills Kit</a> and AWS Lambda running on JavaScript. This was my first experience 
                working with University API's that constantly generated security tokens. While the project was not released for 
                University use, it was indicative of the potential voice-assistants have in improving students learning experience.
                I have attached a video below that demonstrates the skill being tested.

            <p>
                <br/> For the fourth project of my Spring AI course, I was asked to create a random sudoku puzzle
                            generator using a Java constraint solver named "Choco". Unlike normal programming, constraint solvers make certain
                            tasks easier to solve and thus are use widely when training autonomous systems. For this project, I created a 
                            9x9 grid and used nested for loops to specify that all values in a row must be different and all values in a column must be 
                            different. Then, I created additional constraints that outlined values in each 3x3 grids must be different. The result was 
                            a random sudoku puzzle that was solely created by the Choco solver. This project was a great example of how machine
                            learning is often facilitated by constraint solvers that don't require users programming every single instance of logic.
